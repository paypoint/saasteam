# 1. Database Foundations

This chapter introduces the core ideas behind databases.  
The goal is **conceptual clarity first**, then light hands-on exposure — not memorizing syntax.

---

## 1. What Is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be **stored, accessed, updated, and managed efficiently**.

Examples of data stored in databases:

- Users of an app
- Orders and payments
- Products and inventory
- Logs and activity records

Instead of keeping data scattered across files, databases provide:

- structure
- speed
- safety
- consistency

---

## 2. Why Databases Exist (Files vs Databases)

### ❌ Using Files (Problems)

Storing data in files (CSV, JSON, text files) causes issues:

- No structure enforcement
- Difficult to search and update
- No concurrency control
- High risk of data corruption
- No security or access control

Example:

```txt
user1, john@gmail.com, 9876543210
user2, jane@gmail.com, 9123456789
```

### ✅ Using Databases (Benefits)

Databases solve these problems by:

- enforcing structure (tables, columns)
- supporting fast queries
- handling multiple users safely
- providing backup and recovery
- securing sensitive data

---

## 3. Types of Databases (Overview)

Databases are broadly classified into:

- Relational databases (SQL)
- NoSQL databases

Each type is designed for different use cases.

---

## 4. Relational Databases (SQL)

Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns.

Popular SQL databases:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server

Characteristics:

- Fixed schema
- Strong consistency
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
- Supports joins and constraints

Example table:

| id  | name  | email           |
| --- | ----- | --------------- |
| 1   | Rahul | rahul@email.com |
| 2   | Anita | anita@email.com |

---

## 5. NoSQL Databases (Overview)

NoSQL databases are designed for:

- flexibility
- large-scale systems
- high performance

They do not rely strictly on tables.

### 5.1 Document Databases (MongoDB)

- Store data as JSON-like documents
- Flexible schema
- Easy to evolve data structure

Example document:

```json
{
  "name": "Rahul",
  "email": "rahul@email.com",
  "orders": 5
}
```

Use cases:

- User profiles
- Content management systems

### 5.2 Key-Value Stores (Redis)

- Data stored as key → value pairs
- Extremely fast
- Often used in memory

Example:

```txt
"user:101" → "Rahul"
```

Use cases:

- Caching
- Session storage
- Rate limiting

### 5.3 Column-Based Databases (Cassandra)

- Data stored by columns instead of rows
- Designed for huge datasets
- High write performance

Use cases:

- Analytics
- Time-series data
- Event logging

---

## 6. In-Memory Databases

- Data stored in RAM instead of disk
- Very fast
- Data may be temporary

Common use cases:

- Caching
- Real-time analytics
- Session management

Example: Redis used as in-memory cache.

---

## 7. OLTP vs OLAP (Overview)

### OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

- Many small transactions
- Insert, update, delete operations
- Used by applications

Example:

- Banking transactions
- E-commerce orders

### OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)

- Large data analysis
- Aggregations and reporting
- Used by analysts

Example:

- Sales reports
- Business dashboards

---

## 8. Tables, Rows, and Columns

In relational databases:

- **Table** → collection of records
- **Row** → single record
- **Column** → attribute of data

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

---

## 9. Primary Keys and Foreign Keys

### Primary Key

- Uniquely identifies a row
- Cannot be NULL
- Must be unique

Example:

```sql
id INT PRIMARY KEY
```

### Foreign Key

- References primary key of another table
- Creates relationships

Example:

```sql
user_id INT REFERENCES users(id)
```

---

## 10. Constraints

Constraints enforce data rules.

### NOT NULL

```sql
name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
```

### UNIQUE

```sql
email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
```

### DEFAULT

```sql
status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active'
```

---

## 11. Creating Tables

Example: Creating a `users` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  created_at DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```

---

## 12. Inserting Sample Data

Insert a single row:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email)
VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 'rahul@email.com');
```

Insert multiple rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email)
VALUES
  (2, 'Anita', 'anita@email.com'),
  (3, 'Karan', 'karan@email.com');
```
